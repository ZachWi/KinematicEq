# Kinematic Equation Solver
Here's a pretty basic way to solve some 3 value kinematic problems.
I will be updating this pretty fast, as the development time per equation is very low, with minor changes coming with every new formula.
I'm not completely sure when this will be done, as this is just a pet project.
WARNING: I will not be held responsible for anyone using this in a class, during a test, or AP Exam. I am just making this to become more familiar with math based programming. 
THANKS!!!
